        <p>We're leaving together, But still it's farewell And maybe we'll come back,<br> To earth, who can tell?<br> I guess there is no one to blame <br> We're leaving ground Will things ever be the same again?</p>

    <div class="second-verse">
        <p>We're heading for Venus 
And still we stand tall 
Cause maybe they've seen us
And welcome us all yeah
With so many light years to go
And things to be found 
I'm sure that we'll all miss her so. </p>
